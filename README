== Ruby code is evaluated in `*.js` without the `erb` extension

Steps to reproduce

1. Install the bundle, rake the database, and start the server.

2. Navigate to "/legs/new".

3. Enter a (turkey) leg name in the field and click submit.

4. A javascript alert tag will appear from `legs/create.js` that contains the name you just submitted.
